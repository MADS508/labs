# ADS-508
This repo is adapted from the official [Data Science on AWS repo](https://github.com/data-science-on-aws/data-science-on-aws) and adjusted to reflect the capabilities of AWS Learner Labs.

# Important! :warning::warning::warning:
‚ùó When asked to login to a Canvas account, you will need to create a new account. This is the AWS Canvas account, and will not be the same as your USD Canvas account.

- In AWS Learner Labs once you reach $50 all of your code will be automatically destroyed. In addition, AWS Learner Labs has occasional issues where your environment is not accessible.
- **Be sure that you are ALWAYS storing your code in GitHub. You will not be given extra time to complete an assignment due to your Learner Lab deleting your code.**
- In order to make it easy to complete labs and work on your project, it is highly reccomended that you follow the below process, and at the step where you will create a JupyterLab Space, create two (one for a `lab` one for a `project`. Be sure you are saving your work from the `project` JupyterLab Space to your own GitHub repository.


# Setup Instructions

## 1. Login to AWS Learner Labs

![Console](img/aws_console.png)
Be sure to read the [AWS Academy Learner Lab Student Guide.pdf](https://github.com/MADS508/labs/files/12005191/AWS.Academy.Learner.Lab.Student.Guide.pdf)


## 2. Launch the AWS Lab
Within the Learner Lab Setup Guide follow the steps in the [Using Your Learner Lab](https://ole.sandiego.edu/bbcswebdav/pid-2625324-dt-content-rid-35250884_1/xid-35250884_1) section.

2. Click `Launch AWS Academy Learner Lab`
![LearnerLabStep2](img/LearnerLabsStep2_2_1.png)

3. In the top right click `Start Lab` This will take 2-3 minutes. Be sure to monitor your budget, once you reach $100 all of your code will be automatically destroyed. **Be sure that you are ALWAYS storing your code in GitHub.

- For How do you want to access studio, choose Login through IAM
- Leave Who will use Sagemaker blank
- Choose Next.
- If there is a red warning banner that complains about `There is an issue when requesting the service quota. Please try again.`, Ignore it it will not impact your Lab.
![Users](img/usersandMl20.png)

For Configure roles and ML activities

## 5. Clone this GitHub Repo in the Terminal

Within the Terminal, run the following:
`git clone -b main https://github.com/mads508/labs.git`

If you see an error like the following, just re-run the command again until it works:
```
fatal: Unable to create '.git/index.lock': File exists.

Another git process seems to be running in this repository, e.g.
an editor opened by 'git commit'. Please make sure all processes
are terminated then try again. If it still fails, a git process
may have crashed in this repository earlier:
remove the file manually to continue.
```
_Note:  Just re-run the command again until it works._

## 6. Navigate to Lab 01
- On the Left hand side click the icon of the folder

# Shutting Down Sagemaker: Important! :warning::warning::warning:
When you are done working for the day (or more than 1 hour) you must shutdown both Jupyter Labs AND Learner Labs, else you will continue to spend budget. This video shows how.

# Creating a Public S3 Bucket
In order to easily share your source files, you may want to upload them to S3. In order to do this one group member will need to make a public S3 bucket and load the source files to it. This will allow other group members to read (not write to the bucket) the raw files, in order to copy them to their Sagemaker space/own bucket for processing.
[<img src="img/youtube_screen.png" width="100%">](https://youtu.be/ZvOR2RgGLNY)
You can use this bucket policy as a starting spot, be sure to change the bucket name to your bucket name.

# Using Github with Sagemaker for your project
If you are having trouble connecitng your project github repo to Sagemaker, give this a watch.

# Creating Athena Tables for Multiple Datasets
If you use AWS Athena and have more than one file format, its important they you copy your source data from your public bucket into your sagemaker generated S3 bucket, and structure them into folders so that Athena can read the data. This short video explains how.
